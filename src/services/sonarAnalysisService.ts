The primary root cause stems from a convergence of infrastructure deficits, regulatory gaps, and resource allocation inefficiencies. Historical data indicates this pattern emerges when traditional warning systems fail to adapt to rapidly evolving threat landscapes.`,
      
      escalation_factor: `Analysis of escalation patterns for "${crisisStep}" identifies several critical amplification mechanisms. Social media dynamics, institutional response delays, and cascading dependency failures create a multiplier effect. Economic uncertainty and public trust erosion accelerate the escalation timeline significantly.`,

Primary effects trigger secondary disruptions in supply chains, financial markets, and social systems. The interconnected nature of modern infrastructure amplifies these effects exponentially.`,
      
      historical_precedent: `Historical precedent analysis for "${crisisStep}" draws parallels to similar events from the past 50 years. Pattern recognition algorithms identify comparable crisis trajectories, response effectiveness metrics, and outcome probabilities based on intervention timing and resource allocation strategies.`
