Primary drivers include systemic vulnerabilities, resource constraints, and cascading failures across critical infrastructure. The analysis indicates that early warning systems may have been compromised, leading to delayed response mechanisms. Historical data suggests similar patterns emerged during previous crisis events, with contributing factors including inadequate preparation, resource allocation challenges, and communication breakdowns between key stakeholders.`,
      
      escalation_factor: `Escalation analysis for "${crisisStep}" identifies several critical amplification mechanisms. Key factors include rapid information spread through digital channels, potential for public panic, resource scarcity creating competition, and breakdown of normal coordination protocols. The scenario shows high probability for cascading effects across multiple sectors, with particular vulnerability in interconnected systems. Time-sensitive decision making becomes critical as window for containment narrows progressively.`,
      
      cascading_effect: `Cascading effect analysis of "${crisisStep}" reveals potential for multi-domain impact propagation. Primary cascades likely to affect economic systems, social stability, infrastructure resilience, and international relations. Secondary effects may include supply chain disruptions, population displacement, environmental degradation, and long-term institutional damage. The interconnected nature of modern systems means localized impacts can rapidly expand to regional or global scales through network effects.`,
      
      historical_precedent: `Historical precedent analysis for "${crisisStep}" draws from comparable crisis events across multiple timeframes and geographic regions. Similar scenarios have occurred with varying outcomes depending on response effectiveness, resource availability, and international cooperation levels. Key lessons from previous events indicate the importance of early intervention, clear communication protocols, resource pre-positioning, and multi-stakeholder coordination. Analysis shows that successful crisis resolution typically requires sustained commitment over extended periods.`
