## 🎯 Demo Flow (3 Minutes)

### **Scene 1: Problem Statement (0:00 - 0:30)**

**What to Show**: Dashboard with global map

**Script**:
> "In 2024, the world experienced over 12,000 cyber attacks, 40+ pandemic-level health crises, and 200+ climate disasters. Traditional intelligence systems are overwhelmed - they're reactive, siloed, and too slow.
>
> Global Sentinel changes this. It's Earth's first AI-powered immune system - detecting, analyzing, and responding to global threats in real-time using Google Cloud's Vertex AI and Elastic's hybrid search."

**Actions**:
1. Open dashboard at `http://localhost:8080`
2. Show global map with threat markers
3. Highlight real-time threat count in header
4. Zoom to show threats in different regions

**Key Talking Points**:
- 50+ data sources monitored every 5 minutes
- AI-powered analysis, not keyword matching
- Real-time, not hourly/daily reports

---

### **Scene 2: Elastic Hybrid Search (0:30 - 1:15)**

**What to Show**: Search functionality with Elastic hybrid search

**Script**:
> "Traditional search only finds exact keyword matches. But threats don't always use the same words. That's why we use Elastic's hybrid search - combining BM25 keyword matching with semantic vector search powered by Google Cloud embeddings.
>
> Watch what happens when I search for 'critical infrastructure attacks'..."

**Actions**:
1. Open browser DevTools → Network tab
2. Type in search (if you have search UI), OR use curl:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/elastic/search \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "query": "critical infrastructure cyber attacks",
       "searchType": "hybrid",
       "limit": 10
     }' | jq
   ```
3. Show results returned
4. Explain the scoring:
   - BM25 score (keyword matching)
   - Vector similarity score (semantic understanding)
   - Combined ranking

**Alternative Search Queries**:
- `"ransomware hospitals healthcare"`
- `"power grid vulnerabilities Eastern Europe"`
- `"supply chain attacks semiconductor"`

**Key Talking Points**:
- Hybrid search finds threats even with different wording
- Vector embeddings understand context (e.g., "hospital" = "healthcare")
- Sub-200ms response time for complex queries
- Elastic aggregations show stats by type, severity, region

**DevTools Highlight**:
Show the response JSON:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "threats": [
    {
      "title": "Major ransomware attack on...",
      "severity": 85,
      "type": "Cyber",
      "elastic_score": 12.45,  // ← Highlight this
      ...
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "total": 8,
    "avgConfidence": 76
  }
}
```

---

### **Scene 3: AI Agent with Function Calling (1:15 - 2:00)**

**What to Show**: Conversational AI agent with tool usage

**Script**:
> "But search is just the beginning. Our AI agent, powered by Google Cloud's Gemini 2.0, doesn't just find information - it understands intent and takes action using function calling.
>
> Watch as I ask the agent to simulate a crisis scenario..."

**Actions**:
1. Click **AI Chat** button (bottom-right of dashboard)
2. Type: `"Simulate a major cyberattack on the US power grid"`
3. Watch agent:
   - Show "Analyzing..." loader
   - Display tool call: `simulate_crisis`
   - Stream response token-by-token
   - Show grounded sources from Google Search

**Expected Agent Response**:
```
🔧 TOOL USED: SIMULATE_CRISIS

Based on analysis with Google Search grounding:

📊 SCENARIO: Major cyberattack on US power grid

🎯 CASCADING EFFECTS:
1. Immediate Impact (0-2 hours):
   - 40M+ households without power
   - Hospital emergency systems on backup (6-12hr capacity)

- `"Verify the credibility of threat ID: 12345"`
- `"What are the trending threat types this month?"`

**Key Talking Points**:
- Agent understands complex queries (not just keywords)
- Function calling = agent can use tools (`search`, `simulate`, `verify`)
- Google Search grounding = real-time facts, not hallucinations
- Streaming responses = feels instant, not waiting for full response

**DevTools Highlight**:
Show the request/response:
```json
// Request
{
  "message": "Simulate a major cyberattack on US power grid",
  "sessionId": "demo-session-123"
}

// Response (partial)
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Based on analysis with Google Search grounding...",
  "toolCalls": [
    {
      "tool": "simulate_crisis",
      "parameters": {
        "scenario": "major cyberattack on US power grid"
      },
      "result": {
        "severity": 95,
        "cascadingEffects": [...],
        ...
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Scene 4: Real-Time Intelligence (2:00 - 2:30)**

**What to Show**: SIGINT scraper in action

**Script**:
> "All of this intelligence comes from somewhere. Every 5 minutes, our SIGINT scraper pulls from 50+ sources - Reddit, Twitter, BBC, Reuters, CISA, WHO, and more.
>
> Gemini analyzes each item for threat relevance, categorizes it, scores severity, and Elastic indexes it instantly. Let me trigger a manual scrape..."

**Actions**:
1. Open terminal showing SIGINT logs:
   ```bash
   cd backend/sigint
   npm start
   ```
2. Trigger test scrape:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5001/api/sigint/scrape/test
   ```
3. Show logs:
   ```
   📡 Starting intelligent scrape...
   🔍 Reddit: 12 posts analyzed
   🔍 RSS (BBC): 8 articles analyzed
   🤖 Gemini analysis: 5 threats identified
   📊 Indexed to Elastic: 5 new threats
   ✅ Scrape complete in 8.3 seconds
   ```
4. Go back to dashboard - show new threat appearing

**Key Talking Points**:
- Automated intelligence gathering (no human effort)
- AI-powered relevance filtering (Gemini decides what's a threat)
- Multi-source validation (cross-reference for accuracy)
- Instant searchability (Elastic indexing in <1 second)

**Alternative**: Show manual test
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/sigint/scrape/test \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | jq
```

## 🎤 Script Variations

### If Demo Breaks (Plan B)

**Screen Recording Backup**:
Record everything working BEFORE the demo. If live demo fails, use pre-recorded footage.

**Verbal Recovery**:
> "For time, let me show you a pre-recorded clip of this working..."

**Show Code Instead**:
> "Here's the code that powers this - you can see the Gemini API call with grounding enabled..."

### For Judges (Submission Video)

**Opening Hook**:
> "What if we could detect the next pandemic before it spreads? Or stop a cyberattack before it cripples infrastructure? That's what Global Sentinel does."

**Technical Depth** (for judges who want details):
> "Under the hood, we're using Elastic's BM25 algorithm combined with 768-dimension vector embeddings from Google Cloud's text-embedding model. The hybrid search boosts semantic matches 2x, ensuring relevant results even with fuzzy queries."

**Impact Statement**:
> "This isn't theoretical. In 2015, Ukraine's power grid was attacked - 230,000 people lost power. With Global Sentinel, we could have detected the attack vectors, predicted the cascading effects, and coordinated a faster response."
