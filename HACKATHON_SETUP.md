## 🎬 5-Minute Demo Flow for Judges

### Act 1: The Platform (30 seconds)
1. **Open** `http://localhost:8080`
2. **Show** the Threat Feed with real-world threats
3. **Highlight**: "This is Global Sentinel - Earth's AI immune system monitoring cyber, health, climate, and geopolitical threats in real-time"

### Act 2: AI Command Center (2 minutes) ⭐ **SHOWSTOPPER**
1. **Click** "AI Command" tab
2. **Select** any threat card
3. **Click** quick action: "Verify Threat"
4. **Watch** as AI agent:
   - Shows thinking process
   - Executes Elastic search tools
   - Verifies across sources
   - Returns comprehensive analysis
5. **Ask custom question**: "What are the cascading effects if this escalates?"
6. **Show** AI using multiple tools (Elastic search + Gemini analysis)

**What to Say:**
> "Notice how the AI autonomously decides which tools to use. It's using Elastic's ELSER semantic search to find related threats, then Gemini AI to analyze patterns. This is true agentic AI - not scripted responses."

### Act 3: Advanced Search (1 minute)
1. **Return** to Threat Feed
2. **Use** search bar: "critical infrastructure attacks in Europe"
3. **Show** instant results with relevance scores
4. **Click** filter options (threat type, severity, status)
5. **Highlight**: "This is triple-hybrid search - ELSER semantic + BM25 keyword + vector similarity"

**What to Say:**
> "Look at these relevance scores. We're combining three search methods: Elastic's ELSER for natural language understanding, traditional BM25 for precision, and Gemini embeddings for deep semantic matching."

### Act 4: Live Analytics (1 minute)
1. **Click** "Analytics" tab
2. **Point out**:
   - 7-day threat timeline
   - Regional hotspot maps
   - Threat type radar charts
   - AI-generated insights
3. **Highlight** chaos index and predictive trends

**What to Say:**
> "These aren't static charts - they're powered by Elastic aggregations running in real-time. The AI insights at the bottom use Gemini to analyze patterns we might miss."

### Act 5: Crisis Simulation (30 seconds)
1. **Go back** to a threat card
2. **Click** "Simulate" button
3. **Show** AI generating full crisis scenario with:
   - Timeline projections
   - Cascading effects
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Impact assessments

## 🎯 Q&A Preparation

### "How is this different from basic search?"

> "Traditional search matches keywords. We're using ELSER to understand semantic meaning, so searching 'financial system attacks' will find 'banking infrastructure threats' even without keyword overlap. Then we layer in vector similarity from Gemini embeddings to catch conceptually related threats. Finally, BM25 ensures we don't miss exact matches. The result? Industry-leading recall and precision."

### "What makes your AI agentic?"

> "Our AI doesn't just answer questions - it decides HOW to answer them. When you ask about a threat, it autonomously chooses whether to search Elastic, analyze with Gemini, verify sources, or combine multiple tools. Watch [demo the AI Command Center]. See how it's executing different tools based on context? That's agentic behavior."

### "How does ELSER work?"

> "ELSER is Elastic's semantic text expansion model. Instead of storing vector embeddings separately, it creates semantic expansions directly in the index. This means semantic search with zero external dependencies and better performance. We're using the `semantic_text` field type which handles everything automatically."

### "Can this scale?"

> "Absolutely. Elastic is built for scale - companies use it to search petabytes of data. Our architecture is stateless with Firestore as the source of truth and Elastic as the search layer. We can horizontally scale both. The AI layer uses Google's Vertex AI which auto-scales. For demo purposes we're on single nodes, but production deployment would be trivial."
